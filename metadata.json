    "Title": "ImageMol human beta-secretase-1 (BACE-1) inhibition",
    "Description": "This model has been developed using ImageMol, a deep learning model pretrained on 10 million unlabelled small molecules and fine-tuned in a second step to predict the binding of inhibitors to the human beta secretase 1 (BACE-1) protein. The BACE-1 dataset from MoleculeNet contains 1522 compounds with their associated pIC50. A compound with pIC50 => 7 is considered a BACE-1 inhibitor.\n",
